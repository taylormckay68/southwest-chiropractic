export const aboutText = `Dr. Brad Peterson, DC, is a chiropractor who serves the South Jordan area in Salt Lake City, Utah. As a college student, Dr. Peterson incurred a serious back and neck injury that sent him to the chiropractor whose office happened to be next door to Dr. Peterson's apartment. As he learned from the doctor, and even began to work for him, Dr. Peterson discovered a new direction for his life and entered Palmer College of Chiropractic-West. After graduation in 1987, Dr. Peterson began his private practice and has continued to serve his patients since that time. In his own words: “Being a chiropractic student … taught me about the wholeness of the body and the control of the nervous system. I developed a deep respect for what it means to be human. The miracle of the body, the power of the nervous system, and the impact of stress on these systems fascinated me … every time I asked my patients, 'How are you?' I received a gift in the form of their trust and confidence in me and chiropractic to get them well.”`

export const meetText = `Dr. Peterson is a native of Utah and has spent his whole life here except for serving a church mission in Korea and the years he spent attending chiropractic college in Portland, Oregon. He has always had a fascination of the human body and how it works. When he was a young teenager he suffered from headaches that would not go away despite many medications and different types of treatments. Finally his father took him to a chiropractor, an old man who was as gentle as a teddy bear. After only a couple treatments the headaches were gone and his life was forever changed. He always remembered that experience and when the time came to choose a career, it was an easy decision.`

export const meetText2 = `He opened his clinic in South Jordan in February of 1993 and has been in the same location since. The thing he enjoys most about being a chiropractor is helping people and getting to know them. He considers his job to be that of an educator, to teach people how to take care of their spine and their musculoskeletal system. Realizing that chiropractic is one type of treatment of many that are available, if he can’t help you then he will guide you toward those who can. He and his wife Jalayne are the parents of four children who are grown and now raising families of their own. When he is not treating people in the office, they love to travel, mostly to warm climates where there is an ocean so he can enjoy another passion, scuba diving.
